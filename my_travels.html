    <h1>My Travel Experiences</h1>

        <h2>Exploring Europe</h2>
        <p>One of my assignments at Infosys was with Porsche AG, and I was fortunate to get an opportunity to travel to Germany. Switzerland had always been my childhood dream place to visit. With a Schengen Visa, my wife and I were able to travel all across Europe. Here are some of the memorable places we visited:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Walking the streets of <strong>Rome</strong> (Italy), <strong>Paris</strong> (France), <strong>London</strong> (UK), and <strong>Berlin</strong> (Germany) during both day and night.</li>
            <li>Climbing the <strong>Leaning Tower of Pisa</strong>.</li>
            <li>Gondola ride in <strong>Venice</strong>.</li>
            <li>Visiting the relaxing town of <strong>Salzburg</strong> and its famous salt mines.</li>
            <li>Taking the scenic train ride from <strong>Luzern</strong> to <strong>Jungfraujoch</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Most Memorable Trip: A Lesson in Spain</h2>
        <p>While I was deputed in Germany, my most memorable trip happened in <strong>Spain</strong>. It's an interesting story, and it’s the reason my wife always tells me that I should listen to her more. We were warned about pickpockets in some parts of Europe, and my wife had suggested that I wear jeans instead of formal pants, as it's harder for thieves to pickpocket in jeans. I ignored her warning and opted for formal pants.</p>
        <p>We were boarding a train in <strong>Barcelona</strong> when a man, who had just gotten off the train, re-entered and started pretending to look for his keys under my shoes. As I was distracted, my wife was still getting on the train. The man quickly left, and we were surprised by the strange interaction. A lady on the train then advised me to check my pockets. When I did, my wallet was gone!</p>
        <p>We got off at the next station and returned to the hotel, unsure of what to do. We called the Deutsche Bank help desk, but the customer service agent refused to accept the complaint unless we spoke in German. Luckily, my wife had learned some German and managed to provide the necessary details in the language. By the time we had sorted things out, the thieves had taken around 2500 Euros from the card.</p>
        <p>Though we were able to recover the amount later, we had to file a police report in <strong>Barcelona</strong>, and fortunately, there was a translator available who spoke English. To this day, my wife reminds me of this incident as an example of why I should listen to her!</p>
